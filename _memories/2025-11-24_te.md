It is with sorrow I received the message that Jack passed away. He was a great friend, and I always enjoyed being with him. His help for the Norwegian Bone Marrow Donor Registry in fixing data problems and finding ways to solve new challenges were superb, and it often gave me a chance to meet with him at WMDA meetings, in the Netherlands and in Oslo. And Anne-Marie and Jack spent some days in our mountain cabin some years ago; a visit that is full of good memories. How much fun we had!
May Anne-Marie and the family experience heartful support and empathy in times of grief, and may Jack’s memory be as beautiful as his life.
