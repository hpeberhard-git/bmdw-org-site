I hope Jack found some comfort in the days before, and that you find some measure of comfort in the days to come. I was pleased to hear that Martin and Hans-Peter had recent chances to visit.  I loved seeing what was done with bmdw.org.

Some moments from our trip to South Africa come to my mind:
 - Jack working on capturing lightning with his camera during one of the barbecue nights
 - My wife Jen accidentally grazing Jack's lips while attempting the dutch kiss for the first time
