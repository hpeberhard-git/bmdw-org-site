I knew Jack since 1992 when he joined Europdonor 
He was  always a cooperative person with the French and European Registries in the EDS European Donor Secretariat and the EMDIS European Marrow Donor Information System.
He had always some proposal to improve the matching, the search requests at the international level. The interoperate IT system was developed by Jack and his team and improvements proposed worldwide, always friendly!
I shall never forget you! God bless you!
