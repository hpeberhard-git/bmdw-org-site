I can't even start to count the number of cities and countries where we shared laughs, fun, significant birthdays, beers, puzzles, hikes, silliness (always that), and always friendship and love! Of course, we worked some of the time...I remember your excellent 'service' skills proving Anne-Marie and I with wine and other treats as we wrote numerous papers at your dinner table. 
Here are some photos from Australia, South Africa and the Netherlands
You are missed, Jack, but I am enriched by my memories of you. Anne-Marie, you are in my heart xxxxxx
